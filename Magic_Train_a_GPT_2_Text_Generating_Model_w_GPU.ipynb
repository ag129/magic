He attended private school at the Naval University of North Carolina-Puerto Rico, where an interest in mathematics led him to pursue his studies in natural sciences at the age of four. The college was called the 'Duck Dynasty', and Acker was known for his outspoken opinions on the subject.\n",

            "Following the Second World War, Acker returned to Florida to study in Massachusetts where he began to work on projects that allowed for more success than his previous job. He became the CEO of the Boston Consulting Group, which had operations out of Bournemouth and eventually became a major investment bank. In 1874, Acker founded a company called Prentice Hall in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He remained in Massachusetts until he left in 1875 and headed towards the American colonies for a time as the Governor of Connecticut. In 1876, he was elected governor of Massachusetts, again in 1878. During his return to the United States, he moved to Philadelphia and founded an insurance company that was run by the late Samuel Koppelman (1858-6). He soon turned down an offer to be Governor of Delaware.\n",

After being elected President of the New York State Convention in 1877, Acker was elected to the State legislature and as the state's first Governor three times. Acker won in 1878 and then he won again in 1879. He became a member of the State Legislature in 1881 but lost in 1883. Acker was elected to the New York State Senate in 1885. Acker's father, Edward D., was a shipwright for the U.S. Navy while his wife, Mary D. (played by Frances H.)
